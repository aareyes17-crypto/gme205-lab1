# Reflection Part 1 For the first lens, abstraction, I chose to inspect the coordinates because they were the aspect of reality that directly define the spatial identity, or position of the data. I excluded the non-spatial attributes of the coordinates to simplify the model. For the second lens, representation, I assume that the CSV represents WGS 84 coordinates, while the coordinates themselves are specific locations within UP campus and areas nearby the campus. 
# Reflection Part 2 For the third lens, responsibility, the script should automatically check for the format of the coordinates, if they were following the format set or not. On the other hand, the human should check the coordinates they chose, if the positions were correct and if they fell within the given area. For the fourth lens, scale, if the dataset becomes very large, it will cause the script or system to crash because it will exceeed the limits of the system that can only process a certain size of dataset.
