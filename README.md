# Reflection Part 1 For the first lens, abstraction, I chose to inspect the coordinates because they were the aspect of reality that directly define the spatial identity, or position of the data. I excluded the non-spatial attributes of the coordinates to simplify the model. For the second lens, representation, I assume that the CSV represents WGS 84 coordinates, while the coordinates themselves are specific locations within UP campus and areas nearby the campus.
